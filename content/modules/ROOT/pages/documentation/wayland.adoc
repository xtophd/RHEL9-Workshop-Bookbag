[NOTE]

The graphical desktop is disabled by default to improve the overall performance of this workshop in the public cloud.  If you have access to the console, as the root user you can switch-on the graphical desktop with 'systemctl isolate'.  Make the change permanent with 'systemctl set-default' option.

== About Wayland

Wayland is a compositor protocol and library implementation of that protocol.  Wayland replaces the legacy X11 protocol with the primary benefit being that it is easier to develop and maintain.  Meaning, Wayland drops many of the X11 specifications that are no longer in use.

That said, Wayland also enables features that are hard or impossible to support under X:

  * input transformation
  * transparent hardware overlays
  * direct rendering
  * isolating clients (sandboxing)
  * ... and plenty more ( link:https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/Wayland[GNOME Wiki Wayland] )

Wayland was born and raised in the X community, and has strong support.

First introduced to the Fedora community back in version 25, Wayland has been under development for several years before it's introduction in RHEL 8.   Wayland is the new standard in graphical desktop environments.

For more information, see the resources listed below.

NOTE:  X11 is still shipped with RHEL 8, but requires manual installation as it is not the default installed compositor protocol

== Installation & Configuration

=== Packages and Services

The graphical desktop is included by default in a "Workstation" installation of RHEL 8, but this is not the case in a "Server" installation.

For today’s lab this has already been done for you. In the event you installed a text based RHEL 8 host on your own, you can load and enable Wayland with the following simple steps:

[NOTE]
====
_Native command(s) to install Wayland_
