Each block of commands to execute will be labeled with the expected *user-id* and *host*.  To enhance cut & paste efficiency, the command prompt is omitted from each line.

=== Output

Sample output will be titled with _'Your output should look like this'_ (or _'Command Output'_) and also be indented to help with visual identification.  Sometimes there will also be footnotes and/or callouts.

=== Alternate Commands

The workshop often provides workshop-scripts to ease certain complex tasks.  This helps the class stay focused and reduces the likelihood of errors and disruptions to the workshop delivery.  Honestly, we are not here to learn `vi`, `emacs` or start debates about the merits of `sed` and `awk`.

The native commands which the workshop-scripts utilize will be documented in the following way.

.[root@master ~]#
----
workshop-service-status.sh

[NOTE]
====
_Native command(s) to verify system service_
